NOTES:
This website is currently served on github pages.
It is desired to keep the site as static as possible to ease maintenance and avoid unnecessary complexity.
A certain level of modularity is desired as time evolves.
In particular, the navbar and footer need to have a certain amount of modularity for ease of inclusion in external portions of the Brothers Flint website, such as blog, store, etc.
This was originally intended to be implemented via Web Components (Polymer), but performance outside of Chrome was less than desirable.
Partial files, such as navbarfooter.css, are served to external sites that do not need the entire site's stylesheet.
The site is currently built locally via mustache with the (exceedingly beautiful :P) build.sh script.
This was all done very quick and dirty, officializing with Grunt/Bower/Minifiers/NPM is all desirable stuff as time permits.
